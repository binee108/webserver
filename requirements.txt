# Requirements for run.py CLI
# This file contains dependencies needed to run the CLI commands:
# python run.py [start/stop/restart/clean/setup/logs/status/delete_db/ls]
#
# Note: The web application runs in Docker containers, so Flask and other
# web dependencies are NOT included here. This is only for the CLI tool.

sqlalchemy>=2.0.0,<3.0.0

# PostgreSQL driver (required by SQLAlchemy for database migrations)
